## Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers switch from one service provider to another or discontinue using a service altogether. Churn prediction models help businesses understand the factors contributing to customer churn and take appropriate actions to retain valuable customers.

In this project, we aim to build a customer churn prediction model, leveraging machine learning algorithms and a dataset of historical customer information.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information and churn status. It includes various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and service subscription details. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before training the predictive model.

## Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vodafone-churn-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset:
   - Explore and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Perform feature engineering and selection.

2. Train and evaluate the churn prediction model:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Select a suitable machine learning algorithm.
   - Train the model using the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

3. Make predictions:
   - Use the trained model to predict churn for new customer data.
   - Explore the model's predictions and interpret the results.

## Methodology

The project follows the following methodology:

1. Data preprocessing:
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
   - Data cleaning, handling missing values, and outliers.
   - Feature engineering and selection.

2. Model development:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms.
   - Training and fine-tuning the models.
   - Evaluating model performance using relevant metrics.

3. Model deployment:
   - Deploying the trained model for churn prediction.
   - Creating a user-friendly interface for making predictions.
   - Monitoring and updating the model as new data becomes available.

## Results

The project's results include:

- Evaluation metrics for the trained churn prediction model.
- Visualizations and insights derived from the data analysis.
- Predictions and recommendations for customer churn.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for customer churn prediction with an 85% accurate prediction statistics using the HistGradientBoosting Classifier. By accurately identifying customers at risk of churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and improve customer satisfaction.
